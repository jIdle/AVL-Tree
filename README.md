# AVL Tree

I am using this project as an opportunity to learn Golang better, as well as a way to better understand AVL trees before moving on to the WAVL implementation.

The AVL tree has been completed and tested. 
All basic BST functionality is there and working. 
All AVL functionality is there and working.
Height/Balance property optimizations have been added such that node height & balance are updated in constant time during Insert and Remove backtracking.

A stretch goal for this implementation is to allow the AVL tree to store arbitrary types using Golang Interface types.
