# AVL Tree

I am using this project as an opportunity to learn Golang better as well as a way to better understand AVL trees before moving on to the WAVL implementation.
The AVL tree has been completed and tested. All basic BST functionality is there and working. All AVL functionality is there and working.
The only changes left to be made are performance optimizations to the Insert and Remove functions. Though these changes will not be made until some later time.
