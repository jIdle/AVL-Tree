# WAVL Tree

This is a work-in-progress. I am using the project as an opportunity to learn Golang better.

All BST functionality has been implemented and tested successfully.
WAVL insertion is identical to AVL insertion, therefore the next step in this project is to implement AVL insertion using rank differences rather than rank = height.
